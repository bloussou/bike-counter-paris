This repository is set up using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) so running `poetry install` will set up the environment.

Without poetry, python dependencies specified under the [tool.poetry.dependencies] in the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) file are needed to run `main.ipynb`.

## Run

`main.ipynb` is the notebook containing the analysis, the other notebooks were used to clean data.
